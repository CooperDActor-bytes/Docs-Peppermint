### Welcome to Peppermint üçµ
We are an Open Source Ticket Management System hoping to improve the user experience for people in teams or using similar software on their own. Our aim is to create software which is easy to use but still offers all the feature rich components paid solutions have.   

Using docker-compose we can quickly get a copy of the production build, the following docker-compose below can be used to get the up to date production build of Peppermint.


```
version: "3.1"

services:
  postgres:
    container_name: postgres
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./docker-data/db:/data/db
    environment: 
      POSTGRES_USER: peppermint
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 1234
      POSTGRES_DB: peppermint

  client:
    container_name: peppermint
    image: pepperlabs/peppermint:latest
    ports:
      - 5000:5000
    restart: on-failure
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    environment:
      PORT: 5000
      DB_USERNAME: peppermint
      DB_PASSWORD: 1234
      DB_HOST: 'postgres'
      BASE_URL: "http://localhost"
```

Then you can log in by going over to http://localhost:5000

and use the login info of 

```
admin@admin.com
1234
```

This should log you in and take you to the home page
